# Suricata-IDS-Logs-Monitoring-with-Wazuh
In this project, you will integrate Suricata IDS logs with Wazuh SIEM for centralized monitoring. You will configure Wazuh to ingest Suricata’s eve.json output, which includes DNS, TLS, and SSH logs. This enables detection and visualization of network-based threats in real-time.
